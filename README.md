Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register


This project implements a Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register (FibLFSR) in C++. The LFSR is a pseudo-random number generator that operates on a binary seed using bitwise XOR and left shifts. It simulates a feedback shift register commonly used in cryptography and digital signal processing. There are two specific functions in this project which are step() and generate(int k). The step() functions advances the LFSR by one step. It computes the feedback bit by XOR-ing selected tap positions, shifts the register left by one, and inserts the new bit at the rightmost position. The generate(int k) function repeats the step() operation k times to generate a k-bit pseudo-random number. To implement the register efficiently, I used a 16-bit unsigned integer (uint16_t). This choice matches the LFSR register size and enables precise control over individual bits through C++’s built-in bitwise operations. It made the implementation of both step() and generate() straightforward and performant — especially when selecting and XOR-ing tap positions.
